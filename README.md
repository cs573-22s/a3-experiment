## Overview and Design

Here is the [link](https://mnorales.github.io/a3-experiment/) to our project site. 

The purpose of this experiment is to determine which method of manipulating a graph to make it misleading is the most effective. We test three different kinds of visualizations: the pie chart, the histogram, and the scatter plot. Each visualization is manipulated in a different way. For the pie chart, the data is inaccurately represented through the slices. For the histogram, the x-axis makes the interpretation of the data ambigous. For the scatter plot, the upward trend of deaths is flattened through the omission of the y-axis tick labels. We hypothesize that the scatter plot will be least likely to be identified as misleading, due to the fact that participants will have to mouseover the datapoints to interpret the data correctly. 

Questions Asked:
- Do you think the graph is misleading? (yes/no)
- Why or why not? (short answer)

<br/>


### Graph 1: Pie Chart

<img src="PieChart.PNG" width="400" height="400">

**Description:**

This pie chart compares deaths per 100,000 for males and females and shows the total. The misleading part of this graph is that the total is included as its own entity, which makes it the third slice. A more accurate representation of the information would be for the pie chart to only include male and female as the slices. The total would be better shown separately with just the numerical value. Also the male and female values do not add up to the total because male, female, and total are all averages of the raw data columns. However, because the direct values are not given, this remains unclear to the participants who are viewing the chart.

**Hypothesis:**

Participants will have difficulty understanding that the pie chart is misleading and why. 

<br/>


### Graph 2: Histogram

<img src="histogram.PNG" width="500" height="400">

**Description:**

This histogram shows the number of overdose deaths for each age group. The histogram is misleading because only the first age in each age group range is listed, which makes the x-axis unclear and leaves the data open for interpretation. A better histogram would have no spaces in between the bars and the full range for each age group, ie. 25-34. 

**Hypothesis:**

Participants will have difficulty understanding that the histogram is misleading and why.

### Graph 3: Scatterplot

**Hypothesis:**

Participants will have difficulty understanding that the scatter plot is misleading and why.

## Technical Achievements 

<img src="tooltip.PNG" width="650" height="300">

Our technical achievement is the mouseover tooltip found in the scatterplot. The tooltip shows the year and number of deaths for a datapoint when moused over, and is not shown otherwise.
