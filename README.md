Description of Experiment:

The goal of our experiment is to test the effectiveness of word clouds and their capability of being utilized to identify main points and summarizations of written articles. The experiment utilized five different articles, all of different topics to see if the topic impacted how individuals would be able to identify the corresponding word cloud. Participants were asked to read an excerpt of an article, and we would present 3 different word clouds. The participants had to select the word cloud that was associated with the excerpt they just read. The word cloud choices were all about similar topics, but generated using different articles. The participants would be presented an excerpt of an article. After reading it, they would be presented the word cloud choices and select the correct one. This was done for each of the five articles. The participants were only informed that they would complete a study about word clouds, but they did not have any prior knowledge on what the articles would be about or what they were be expected to do.
