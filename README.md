## Overview and Design

Here is the [link](https://mnorales.github.io/a3-experiment/) to our project site. 

(what we are testing, overall hypothesis, data, etc.)

Questions Asked:
- Do you think the graph is misleading? 
- Why or why not?


### Graph 1: Pie Chart

**Description:**

This pie chart compares deaths per 100,000 for males and females and shows the total. The misleading part of this graph is that the total is included as its own entity, which makes it the third slice. A more accurate representation of the information would be for the pie chart to only include male and female as the slices. The total would be better shown separately with just the numerical value. Also the male and female values do not add up to the total because male, female, and total are all averages of the raw data columns. However, because the direct values are not given, this remains unclear to the participants who are viewing the chart.

**Hypothesis:**
The hypothesis here is:
